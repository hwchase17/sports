    "# Record Linkage for NBA Player Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR: This notebook will walk through an example of using simple machine learning to perform record linkage for two NBA player databases (www.stats.nba.com and www.basketball-reference.com). I will show why this is (maybe) neccessary, provide explanations for the general steps inthe record linkage pipeline, and then execute this pipeline on the aformentioned data. If you have any questions/comments, or simply would like to see this done on more datasets, please feel free to reach out via email (hw.chase.17@gmail.com) or twitter (@aabsblog) - more than happy to chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the code has been factored out into helper files and then imported here, mainly for making this notebook more readable. The factored out code may not be commented/explained as well as the code in here, but if you are looking at it and have questions feel free to reach out and I can try to add better documentation.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is record linkage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Record Linkage is the process of matching a record from one datasource to an record in another data source. This idea is not a new idea - [here is a paper](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2572&context=cstech) from 2003 that describes what is going on. At a high level, this paper describes three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Searching Methods (also called *Blocking*): find somewhat similar records across two datasets\n",
    "1. Comparision Functions (also called *Modeling*):  compare the pairs of records you found in Step 1 in a more detailed way\n",
    "1. Decision Models (also called *Postprocessing*): make decisions based on Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why should I care about record linkage?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is so much data on the internet these days. Even just considering basketball stats, I would say there are three main sites people go to for data: www.stats.nba.com, www.basketball-reference.com, and www.espn.com. Each of these sites contains their own datasets, with similar but perhaps slightly different information. While it is possible to get away with just using one of these sites, one can easily imagine that it might be desirable to pull in information from all three sites. Since all three sites have their own unique identifiers (or uuids) for each player, you would need to link these uuids to eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is it hard to link players from one datasource to another? Can't I just join on their name?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason it is not trivial to do so is that a player's information may actually be slightly different accross the two sites. Names can be mispelled, nicknames could be used, years active could actually be different - all very small, but incredibly annoying things that make doing a join not possible - at least for all players.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But surely it would be sufficient for most players?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is true. As I'll show in this notebook, a trivial join can join roughly 90% of players.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If a trivial join works so well, is this linking exercise really neccessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest - no. If my goal was to simply link these two datasets I would use a trivial join, knock out 90% of the players, and then link the rest by hand - that would probably be faster than writing all this code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### So then why did you do this?\n",
    "Two reasons. One, I think linking is an incredibly powerful tool and is useful in a ton of situations. In most situations you won't have a trivial rule to do joins on like you do here, and so this process is more neccessary. I wanted to give an example of this process, and I really like working with sports data, so I thought this would be a fun dataset. Second, having done this I could now actually use this for other tasks. Most simply, I could use this same pipeline, maybe even the same model, to link ESPN data to basketball-reference data. More complexly, I could probably use a lot of this pipeline to link football players, or soccer players, etc."

Coming up with all these features was a combination of trying stuff out that I intuitively thought would be helpful, as well as doing error inspection on an earlier version of the model and then adding more features to hopefully \"fix\" those errors.

How did I come up with these? I trained a model based on initial labels, then found players that the model did not find a good match for, labeled those manually, and added those to the training dataset.
